# Data Privacy Preserving Applications with R

## Abstract
If public policymakers had access to our personal and confidential data, they
could make more evidence-based, data-informed decisions that could accelerate
economic recovery and improve COVID-19 vaccine distribution. However, access
to personal data comes at a steep privacy cost for contributors, especially
underrepresented groups. Revealing too much location information places people
at risk such as empowering stalkers to track people more easily, but too 
little personal, location information will severely hinder the effectiveness
of contact tracing. 

In this presentation, I will cover the basics of data privacy preserving
methods and go indepth on one method, synthetic data generation, and how to
generate your own synthetic data using R.
